What is React.js?
Definition: React.js, often referred to as React, is an open-source JavaScript library primarily used for building user interfaces (UIs)
 	    and single-page applications (SPAs).

Developed by: Developed and maintained by Facebook.

Key Features: Known for its simplicity, efficiency, and component-based architecture.

Key Concepts:

Components:

Components are the building blocks of React applications.
They are reusable, encapsulated elements that manage their state and can be composed to build complex UIs.
Components can be functional (using functions) or class-based (using ES6 classes).
JSX (JavaScript XML):

JSX is a syntax extension that allows mixing HTML-like code within JavaScript.
It simplifies the process of creating React elements and makes code more readable.
Virtual DOM (Document Object Model):

React uses a virtual DOM, which is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM.
This virtual representation helps in efficiently rendering UI components by minimizing direct manipulation of the DOM.
Unidirectional Data Flow:
  
Basic Setup:
Create React App:
Use create-react-app to set up a new React project quickly without complex configurations.
Command to create a new React app: npx create-react-app my-app.
Start the development server: cd my-app then npm start.
