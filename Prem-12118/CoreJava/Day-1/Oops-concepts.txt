 Oops major concepts as notes:


Class:
Blueprint or template for creating objects.

Object: 
Instance of a class with its own state and behavior.

Encapsulation:
Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
Access to data is controlled, and the internal representation is hidden.

Inheritance:
Mechanism for creating a new class (subclass/derived class) that is a modified version of an existing class (superclass/base class).
Allows code reuse and promotes the "is-a" relationship.

Polymorphism:
Ability of objects to take on multiple forms.
Involves method overriding (same method name in derived class) and method overloading (same method name with different parameters).

Abstraction:
Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behavior.
Reduces code complexity by focusing on relevant details.
