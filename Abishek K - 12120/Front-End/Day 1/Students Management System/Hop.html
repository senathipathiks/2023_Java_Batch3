    <h3>About the Hospital</h3>
    <p>A hospital is a healthcare facility that provides specialized medical and nursing care as well as medical supplies to patients. The most well-known form of the hospital is the general hospital, which usually carries an emergency department to handle urgent health issues such as fire and accident victims, as well as medical emergencies.


        According to the hospital definition, a district hospital is usually the region's primary healthcare facility, with a large number of intensive-care beds and extra beds for patients who need long-term care. Trauma centers, children's hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, hospitals, and seniors' (geriatric) hospitals for coping with particular medical conditions such as psychiatric care are also examples of specialized hospitals and several other disease categories. When opposed to general hospitals, specialized hospitals can help save money on health care. Based on the source of revenue, hospitals are categorized as general, specialized, or government.
        
        
        A teaching hospital integrates patient care with medical students as well as nurse education. A clinic is a care facility that is smaller than that of a hospital. A hospital's departments (such as surgery and urgent care) and specialty units (such as cardiology) are diverse. Outpatient departments and chronic care centers are available at certain hospitals. Pathology, pharmacy, and radiology are examples of common support units.
